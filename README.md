To compile and run the Recipe Application software using the provided code, you'll need to follow these steps:

Make sure you have a compatible development environment installed, such as Visual Studio. This will allow you to write and build the application code.

Create a new project in your development environment and choose the appropriate project template for WPF applications. This template will provide the necessary structure and files for your application.

Set up the project by giving it a meaningful name, specifying the location where you want to save it, and configuring any other required settings. This step ensures that your project is properly organized and ready for development.

Once your project is set up, you'll find some default files that were generated for you, such as MainWindow.xaml and MainWindow.xaml.cs. These files contain the user interface design and logic for the main window of your application.

Replace the content of the MainWindow.xaml file with the provided code. This code defines the layout and elements of the main window, including buttons, text boxes, and charts.

Similarly, replace the content of the MainWindow.xaml.cs file with the provided code. This code contains the C# logic that handles user interactions, such as button clicks and data filtering.

After making these changes, save the files to ensure that your modifications are preserved.

Build the project by selecting the appropriate build option in your development environment. For example, in Visual Studio, you can go to the "Build" menu and choose "Build Solution". This process compiles your code into an executable application.

If there are no compilation errors, you can proceed to execute the application. Use the run/debug option provided by your development environment. In Visual Studio, you can click on the "Start Debugging" or "Start without Debugging" button.

Once you run the application, the Recipe Application window should appear on your screen. This window displays an initial list of recipes.

You can now interact with the application using the provided functionality. For example, you can add new recipes, view recipe details, filter recipes based on criteria like ingredients and calories, create menus, and visualize recipe distribution using the pie chart.

Remember that the specific steps may vary depending on your development environment. Also, ensure that you have the necessary frameworks and libraries referenced in your project to successfully compile and run the application.
